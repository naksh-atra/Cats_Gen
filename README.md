## Project Overview

This project is centered on generating cat images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a sophisticated approach in deep learning. The objective was to explore the potential of GANs in creating realistic cat images by training the model on a dataset of cat images.

### Methodology

The GAN model was trained on two different datasets of cat images, each with a varying number of images to evaluate how the quantity of training data impacts the quality of the generated images.

- **First Run:**
  - **Number of Images Used for Training:** 250
  - **Time Taken:** 32 minutes and 44 seconds
  - **Results:** In this initial run, the model was trained on a smaller dataset of 250 images. The training process was relatively quick, and the model began to produce preliminary outputs that showed basic cat-like features. However, the limited amount of training data resulted in some artifacts and less detailed images.

- **Second Run:**
  - **Number of Images Used for Training:** 700
  - **Time Taken:** 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 16 seconds
  - **Results:** The second run involved a larger dataset of 700 images, providing the GAN with more diverse examples to learn from. This extended training period allowed the model to produce more refined and varied outputs, with a noticeable improvement in the clarity and realism of the generated images.

### Outcomes and Implications

The project successfully demonstrated the impact of the dataset size on the performance of GANs in image generation tasks. By increasing the number of training images, the quality of the generated cat images improved significantly, showcasing more realistic and detailed outputs. This experiment highlights the importance of data quantity and diversity in training generative models, and it lays the groundwork for further experimentation with larger datasets and more advanced GAN architectures.
